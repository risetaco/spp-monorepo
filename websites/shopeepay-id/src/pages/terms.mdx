If we are unable to debit your Account balance for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from your Account balance in the future.

8.2 When an unauthorized Transaction or an error occurs in your Account, which will not occurred by you, we may at our absolute discretion, cover you for the amount of every eligible unauthorized Transaction or error as long as you follow the procedures set out below. In any case, our coverage is only limited to the amount of your latest Account balance in our system, or IDR 10,000,000 (ten million Rupiah), whichever is lower. An unauthorized Transaction occurs when a payment is sent from your Account that you did not authorize and did not benefit you i.e. if someone steals your password and/or PIN, uses the password and/or PIN to access your Account, and sends a payment from your Account, an unauthorized Transaction has occurred. If you give someone access to your Account (by giving them your login information) and they conduct transactions without your knowledge or permission, you are responsible for any resulting use.

8.3 You should immediately notify us if you believe:

• there has been an unauthorized Transaction or unauthorized access to your Account;  
• there is an error in your Account history;  
• your password, PIN, and/or unlock code has been compromised;  
• your Account mobile-activated phone has been lost, stolen or deactivated; or  
• you need more information about a transaction listed on the transaction history or transaction confirmation.

8.4 To be eligible for protection for unauthorized Transactions, you must notify us within twenty four (24) hours upon notice of such unauthorized Transactions, but no later than thirty (30) days after any unauthorized Transaction first appears in your Account history. We will extend the time period with reasonable and demonstrable reason, such as a hospital stay, which kept you from notifying us within the time limit. You should regularly log into your Account and review your Account history to ensure that there has not been an unauthorized Transaction or error. We may also send an email to the primary email address you have provided in order to notify you of each transaction from your Account. You should also review these transaction confirmations to ensure that each transaction was authorized and is accurate.

8.5 For unauthorized Transactions or Errors in your Account, notify us through the methods set out in Section 14.

When you notify us, provide us with all of the following information:

• Your name, contact number and email address registered to your Account;

• A description of any suspected unauthorized Transaction or error and an explanation as to why you believe it is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the Transaction; and

• The amount of any suspected unauthorized Transaction or error.

If you notify us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) Business Days. During the course of our investigation, we may request additional information from you.

8.6 Once you notify us of any suspected unauthorized Transaction or error, or we otherwise learn of one, we will do the following:

• We will conduct an investigation to determine whether there has been an unauthorized Transaction or error that is eligible for protection.

• We will complete our investigation within ten (10) Business Days from the date we received your notification of the suspected unauthorized Transactions or error. If your Account is new (the first transaction from your Account was less than thirty (30) business days from the date you notify us), we may take up to twenty (20) Business Days to complete this investigation. If we need more time, we may take up to forty five (45) days to complete our investigation (or up to ninety (90) days for new Accounts, or if your transaction was at a point of sale where you were physically present).

• If we decide that we need more time to complete our investigation, we may, at our sole discretion, provisionally credit your Account for the amount of the suspected unauthorized Transaction or error.

• We will inform you of our decision after completing our investigation.

8.7 If we determine that there was an unauthorized Transaction or error, we will promptly credit the amount into your Account within one (1) Business Day of our determination. Or, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts. If we decide that there was not an unauthorized Transaction or error, we will include an explanation of our decision in our email to you. If you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your Account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit. You may request copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

8.8 We will rectify any error that we discover based on our sole discretion. If the error results in your receipt of less than the correct amount to which you are entitled, we will credit your Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you are entitled, you agree that we may debit the extra funds from your Account.

8.9 If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example), we, in our sole discretion, may choose to assist you to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment. We will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.
